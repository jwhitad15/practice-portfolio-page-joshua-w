        <br />
    My life is great! I wake up, go for a walk, eat something for breakfast, and sit down at my computer to code! <br />
    Here are three things I learned from my coding journey so far:
    <ul>
        <li>Be Patient: Great things take time!</li>
        <li>Practice: Practice makes permanent!</li>
        <li>Take Breaks: Don't forget to enjoy some sunshine!</li> 
    </ul>

    <h1>My Former Life <br /></h1>
    In my past, I was a basketball player. To ensure optimal performance, I made it my business to:
   <ol>
    <li>Arrive Early</li>
    <li>Warmup</li>
    <li>Stretch</li>
    <li>Practice My Skills</li>
</ol>
